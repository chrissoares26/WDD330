<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>One of the most import things on codes. It is necessary so people know what is going on and for the programmer as well</p>
<h3>Constants & Variables</h3>
<p> let = variable and const = constant. It is important to know how to name the variables and constants as well. I can use camel case for that. It is good practice.</p>
<h3>Methods and Porperties</h3>
<p>Methods are followed by "()" and properties are not.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2 summary</h3>
<ul><li>Comments are ignored by the program, but make your program easier to read and understand</li>
<li>Data types are the basic building blocks of all JavaScript programs.</li>
<li>There are six primitive data types: strings, symbols, numbers, Booleans, undefined and null.</li>
<li>Non-primitive data types, such as arrays, functions and objects, all have a type of 'object'.</li>
<li>Variables point to values stored in memory and are declared using the const or let keywords.</li>
<li>Values are assigned to variables using the = operator.</li>
<li>Strings and numbers have various properties and methods that provide information about them.</li>
<li>Symbols are unique, immutable values.</li>
<li>Boolean values are either true or false .</li>
<li>There are only seven values that are false in JavaScript and these are known as 'falsy' values.</li>
<li>Data types can be converted into other data types.</li>
<li>Type coercion is when JavaScript tries to convert a value into another data type in order to perform an operation.</li>
<li>Logical operators can be used to check if compound statements are true or false.</li>
<li>Values can be compared to see if they are equal, greater than or less than other values.</li></ul>
