    <h3> The Document Object Model</h3>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled.
</p>
<h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
<ul><li>The Document Object Model is a way of representing a page of HTML as a tree of nodes.</li>
    <li>The document.getElementById() , document.getElementsByClassName() , document.getElementsByTagNames() and document.querySelector() can be used to access elements on a page.</li>
    <li>The parentNode() , previousSibling() , nextSibling() , childNodes() and children() methods can be used to navigate around the DOM tree.</li>
    <li>An element’s attributes can be accessed using the getAttribute() method, and updated using the setAttribute() method.</li>
    <li>The createElement() and createTextNode() methods can be used to create dynamic markup on the fly.</li>
    <li>Markup can be added to the page using the appendChild() and insertBefore() methods.</li>
    <li>Elements can be replaced using the replaceChild() method, and removed using the removeChild() method.</li>
    <li>The innerHTML property can be used to insert raw HTML directly into the DOM.</li>
    <li>The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the style property.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Forms</h3>
<p>Forms are a very common method of interacting with a web page. A form is the main component of Google’s home page, and most of us use forms every day to log in to our favorite sites. In this chapter, we will look at how forms can be used to interact with a JavaScript program.
</p>
<ul><li>Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.</li>
<li>Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.</li>
<li>HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.</li>
<li>document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.</li>
<li>form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.</li>
<li>Forms have focus , blur , and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form.</li>
<li>Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before it’s been submitted.</li>
<li>The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.</li>
<li>The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form, but only at a basic level, so a custom validation script may be required.</li>
</ul>

<h3>OOP in JavaScript</h3>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. This approach has the benefit of keeping related pieces of code encapsulated in objects that maintain state throughout the life of the program. The objects can also be reused or easily modified, as required. </p>
<ul><li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that uses objects that encapsulate their own properties and methods.</li>
<li>The main concepts of OOP are encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.</li>
<li>Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects.</li>
<li>ES6 introduced class declarations that use the class keyword. These can be used in place of constructor functions.</li>
<li>Inside a constructor function or class declaration, the keyword this refers to the object returned by the function.</li>
<li>All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of its prototype.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modern JavaScript Development</h3>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul><li>JavaScript libraries provide methods to make common tasks easier to achieve.</li>
<li>Libraries can make programming much easier, but you should think carefully about whether you require a library, and which one is best for your needs.</li>
<li>jQuery and Lodash are two popular libraries that provide a large number of useful and well-tested functions.</li>
<li>npm and Yarn are package managers that can be used to install JavaScript packages, as well as any dependencies that they require.</li>
<li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.</li>
<li>ES6 added support for modules, allowing code to be abstracted into their own self-contained files and imported into another file.</li>
<li>The MVC pattern is used to organize code into distinct sections that are responsible for different elements of an application.</li>
<li>Template files can be used to separate view code from JavaScript; they also enable dynamic code and programming logic to be used to generate markup.</li>
<li>React and Vue.js are popular JavaScript view libraries that render components and keep track of their state.</li>
<li>Minification is the process of removing any redundant characters from the code in order to reduce its file size.</li>
<li>Files can be compressed on the server using the gzip compression tool.</li>
<li>Webpack can be used to bundle multiple files into a single bundle, and automate common tasks such as transpiling, minifying code and running tests.</li>
<li>Before code is deployed, it should be concatenated into a single file, minified and compressed. The script tag should be placed just before the closing body tag to ensure that all elements on the page have loaded before the script runs.</li>
</ul>
