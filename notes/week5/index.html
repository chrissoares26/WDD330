    <h3> Testing and Debuging </h3>
    <p>Errors and bugs are a fact of life in programming ― they will always be there. A good programmer will try to do everything to minimize errors occurring, and find ways to identify and deal with them quickly.
</p>
<ul><li>Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.</li>
    <li>JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict" . This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.</li>
    <li>Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.</li>
    <li>Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.</li>
    <li>The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.</li>
    <li>Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.</li>
    <li>An error object is created when an exception occurs.</li>
    <li>Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur.</li>
    <li>Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.</li>
    <li>The Jest framework can be used to test your code.</li>
</ul>
